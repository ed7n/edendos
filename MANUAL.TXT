EDEN's DOS Portal: Manual (MANUAL.TXT)
--------------------------------------
u3r0 by Brendon, 01/23/2019.

Welcome to EDENdos update 3!


Installation
------------
1.  Extract EDENdos <version>.zip into a folder of your desire.

...that's it, just remember where you put it.


Getting Started
---------------
Start by running edendos.bat and read the general warning that follows.

You will be shown a list of scripts available for use, then be brought to the
EDENdos prompt. It should appear like the following:

    Me@MyPC/EDENdos/_>

Where "Me" is your user name and "MyPC" is your computer name.

Read the on-screen instructions.

Some scripts require administrative privileges to proceed. If you wish to run
them, ensure that you have such permissions. Run edendos.bat as an administrator
(File > Run as administrator). You can check whether you done this correctly
with "adminchk" at the EDENdos prompt. Running RUN.EXE does the same for you.

EDENdos works on a computer running Windows Vista or later, especially Windows
10, where EDENdos was tested.

Running EDENdos on a computer running Windows XP or older, or using Wine, will
show something but I am sure that it will break.


Optional First-Time Setup
-------------------------
automen and autocln optionally use the following third-party programs:

    BleachBit
    CCleaner
    Wise Disk Cleaner
    Wise Registry Cleaner

1.  Download their portable builds using the following links:

    BleachBit Portable:     [ http://www.bleachbit.org/download/windows ]
    CCleaner Portable:      [ http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/portable/downloadfile ]
    Wise Registry Cleaner:  [ http://www.wisecleaner.com/soft/WDCFree.zip ]
    Wise Disk Cleaner:      [ http://wisecleaner.com/soft/WRCFree.zip ]

You should have 4 archives of the following file names:

    BleachBit-<version>-portable.zip
    ccsetup<version>.zip
    WDCFree.zip
    WRCFree.zip

where <version> denotes the program version, may differ over time.


2.  Extract each archive, except ccsetup<version>.zip, directly into the edendosd
    folder.

Create a new folder inside the edendosd folder and rename it to CCleaner.

Extract ccsetup<version>.zip directly into this new folder.

The edendosd folder should now contain the following folders:

    BleachBit-Portable
    CCleaner
    Wise Disk Cleaner
    Wise Registry Cleaner

where each folder should contain program folders and files. The setupchk script
can verify this for you, run this under EDENdos.


3.  For users with OCD, like me, you may want to configure them in the
    following manner:

    BleachBit (bleachbit.exe):

        Menu > Edit > Preferences >
            Check "Download and update cleaners from community (winapp2.ini)",
            then click OK.

        Wait for "winapp2.ini" to be downloaded. Otherwise, restart the app.

        Check all cleaners except for "Free disk space", ignoring all warnings
        except for ones that state "...can cause issues..." or similar.


    CCleaner (CCleaner.exe):

        Check all cleaners except for "Wipe Free Space".

        Options > Advanced >
            Uncheck "Only delete Windows Temp folders older than 24 hours".


    Wise Disk Cleaner (WiseDiskCleaner.exe):
        Under Common Cleaner, check all cleaners.
